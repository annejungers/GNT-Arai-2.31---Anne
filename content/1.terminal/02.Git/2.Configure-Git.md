# Configure Git & GitHub

## Goals

- Being able to use Git and GitHub using SSH keys

## Deadline

- Estimated duration: 30 minutes

## Instructions

### Your profile on GitHub

Complete your [GitHub profile](https://GitHub.com/settings/profile).
Your name, surname and a recent picture of yourself are required.

### Use GitHub int the terminal (for Linux)

To login into GitHub you need a **SSH-key**.
In the next steps we will see how to generate one and link it to your GitHub account.

#### Generate SSH-key (Linux)

1. Open your terminal
2. Copy the following command into your terminal.
   Change `"your_email@example.com"` with the email address linked to your GitHub account and press `Enter`.

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   This will create an SSH key that is linked to your email

3. Generate a private/public RSA key pair
   When you are asked to `"Enter a file in which to save the key"`, press `Enter`. This will accept the standard location.

4. Enter a file in which to save the key (`/home/_user_name_/.ssh/id_rsa`): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
5. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
6. Enter same passphrase again: [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
7. Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add the SSH key to your GitHub account.

### Use GitHub on the terminal (for **Windows**)

To login into GitHub you need an **SSH-key**.
In the next steps we will see how to generate one and link it to your GitHub account.

#### Generate an SSH-key (for **Windows**)

1. Open you Terminal/cmd.
2. Copy the following command into your terminal.
   Change `"your_email@example.com"` to the email address linked to your GitHub account and press `Enter`.

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   This will create an SSH key that is linked to your email

3. Generate a private/public RSA key pair
   When you are asked to `"Enter a file in which to save the key"`, press `Enter`. This will accept the standard location.

4. Enter a file in which to save the key (`/c/Users/_user_name_/.ssh/id_rsa`): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
5. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
6. Enter same passphrase again: [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
